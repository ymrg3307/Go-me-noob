Just exploring Go!!!

1. Installation
    - Installed Go
    - created 01hello and go into it's path and do `go mod init hello` in terminal
    - Installed Go extension in vs code
    - Sample code in main.go and run `go run main.go`
2. Reading docs and GOPATH
    - `go env GOPATH` -> gives the **GOPATH**, location where source code lives.
    - `go help <command name>` -> gives doc on the mentioned command.
